## 💡 Key Insights

- Global CO₂ emissions have steadily increased since 1950, peaking around 2019.
- China overtook the U.S. in 2006 as the top CO₂ emitter, with emissions rising from 5,882 MtCO₂ (2005) to 6,494 MtCO₂, while the U.S. dropped from 6,132 to 6,053 MtCO₂.
-  India's CO₂ emissions have shown a sharp and steady rise since the 1990s, crossing 3,000 MtCO₂ by 2022, driven by rapid industrialization, population growth, and energy demands.
-  Coal and oil have consistently dominated global CO₂ emissions, remaining the largest sectoral contributors across decades due to widespread use in power generation, transport, and industry.
- Visual tools help highlight which countries are improving vs worsening in emissions impact.
